# Product Sales Analysis with Python 📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing product sales data from Amazon electronics.  
It involves **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using Python & Power BI**.  
The goal is to uncover sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance insights.

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Product_Analysis/Product_Sales_Analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for data analysis (EDA, visualization).  
- `Product_Analysis/electronics.csv` → Original dataset.  
- `Product_Analysis/electronics_cleaned.csv` → Cleaned dataset after preprocessing.  
- `Product_Analysis/DASHBOARDS1.pbix` → Power BI dashboard for visualization.  
- `README.md` → Project documentation.

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Load and clean dataset (handling missing values, duplicates, formatting).  
2. Perform **exploratory data analysis** (EDA).  
3. Identify best-selling products, customer buying patterns, seasonal trends.  
4. Build interactive **Power BI dashboards** for better insights.  

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Power BI** (Dashboard creation)  
- **CSV Dataset** (Amazon Electronics Sales Data)  

## 🚀 Results
- Identified top-performing products & categories.  
- Observed seasonal sales trends.
